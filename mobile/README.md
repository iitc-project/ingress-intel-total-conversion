ingress intel total conversion mobile (IITCM)
=====================================

The Android App behaves like the desktop version, but uses the mobile view, which is optimized for mobile devices, as default. Furthermore, there are some nice additions:

- it should be much faster than the standard mobile ingress intel map

- plugin support

- a geo intent is sent, when a portals Map link is clicked (lets you navigate to portals)

- a geolocate button (you have to enable GPS satellites + location access to use this feature)

- toggle between desktop and mobile view (nice for tablets)

- possibility to use a custom IITC script source

- a click on Portal link copies it to clipboard

- more features will be added soon...

**The App only works with Android 4.0+**
