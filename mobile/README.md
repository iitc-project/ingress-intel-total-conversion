ingress intel total conversion mobile (IITCm)
=====================================

The Android App behaves like the desktop version, but uses the mobile view, which is optimized for mobile devices, as default. Furthermore, there are some nice additions:

- it should be much faster than the standard mobile ingress intel map

- supports all official IITC plugins

- easy installation and update of unofficial plugins (installation via plugin preference, click on *.user.js file or URL, email attachement etc.)

- show users current location

- share interface for portal links, portal navigation etc.

- a geolocate button (you have to enable GPS satellites + location access to use this feature)

- in-app search

- configurable fullscreen modes (includes immersive mode on Android 4.4+)

- navigation drawers for IITC panes, layer chooser and highlighters

- in-app screenshots

- developer mode: all script source will be loaded from ```<storage_path>/IITC_Mobile/dev/```

- more features will be added soon...

**The App only works with Android 4.0+**
