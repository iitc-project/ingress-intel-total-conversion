<h1>Ingress Intel Total Conversion</h1>

<p>
IITC is <a href="https://github.com/breunigs/ingress-intel-total-conversion#readme">dead</a> - long live IITC!
</p>

<p>
The IITC mod is an open source project. Since the original closed, I resurrected it and will try to continue development.
</p>

<p>
If you're interested in further development, come on over to
<a href="https://github.com/jonatkins/ingress-intel-total-conversion">the github page</a>. If you just want to install
and use it, read on.
</p>

<h2>Downloads</h2>

<h3>IITC - browser addon</h3>

<?php

if ( $path != "release" )
	print "<p><b>NOTE</b>: the <b>$path</b> build is currently selected. <a href=\"/\">Return to main build</a>.</p>";
?>

<p>
<b>IMPORTANT!</b>: You <b>must</b> uninstall the original IITC before installing this version. Failure to do this
will result in multiple copes installed which I expect will cause a LOT of issues.
</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE</b>: The first release available here was not configured correctly for auto updates.
If you installed before this note appeared (22nd March 2013) you will need to
manually uninstall IITC and all plugins, then reinstall from below. Going forward, updates will work correctly
(for Chrome + Tampermoneky and Firefox + Greasemonkey users).
</p>

<?php
$iitc_details = loadUserScriptHeader ( "$path/total-conversion-build.user.js" );
?>

<p>
<a href="<?php print $path;?>/total-conversion-build.user.js">IITC main script</a> - <i>version <?php print $iitc_details['@version'];?></i>.
</p>

<h4>Plugins</h4>

<ul>

<?php
foreach ( glob ( "$path/plugins/*.user.js" ) as $path )
{
	$name = basename ( $path, ".user.js" );

	$details = loadUserScriptHeader ( $path );

	print "<li>\n";

	print "<a href=\"$path\">".$details['@name']."</a> <i>$name - version ".$details['@version']."</i>: <br/>\n";
	print $details['@description'];

	print "</li>\n";
}

?>
</ul>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<p>Installation varies depending on browser.</p>

<p>
<b>Chrome</b>:
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo">Tampermonkey</a>
is highly recommended. (Userscripts can be installed directly within the 'extensions' settings, but will not auto update.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Firefox</b>:
The <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Greasemonkey</a> add-on can be used.
</p>

<p>
<b>Opera</b>:
There is a setting for a userscripts folder.
</p>

<h3>IITC - mobile</h3>

<p>
A proper version of mobile will be available in the future. Until then, here's the last build
available from the original IITC page.
</p>

<p>
<a href="mobile/IITC-Mobile-latest.apk">Download</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is likely to have some issues, but should work well enough for now.
</p>
