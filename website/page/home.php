IITC 0.16.4 and IITC Mobile 0.10.4 have just been released. This version is required to fix a bug with showing portal details
due to a change made by Niantic to the intel site protocol. Also, the following changes have been made:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Portal markers are now reduced in size when you zoom out, reducing clutter when viewing large areas of the map</li>
<li>Blocked a 3rd party plugin, arc, from running - it had spyware features hidden within it
(<a href="https://plus.google.com/105383756361375410867/posts/4b2EjP3Du42">details here</a>).</li>
<li>Plugins
 <ul>
 <li>add-kml: support for opening files on mobile added</li>
 <li>regions: new plugin to draw the scoreboard regions on the map. <i>No support for showing scores - this needs Niantic to add it to the standard intel site first</i></li>
 <li>score-cycle-times: new plugin to show the times of the scoreboard cycles</li>
 <li>draw-tools: added basic import/export (via copy+paste), and colour choosing options (click on "DrawTools Opt" in the sidebar)</li>
 <li>compute-ap-stats and portal-names: changed code to reduce the performance impact when a large number of portals are shown</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>Mobile:
 <ul>
 <li>NFC support for sharing map view/selected portal - app permissions updated for this</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>.. plus various minor bugfixes and improvements</li>
</ul>
