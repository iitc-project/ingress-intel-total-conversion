<h3>Latest news</h3>

<h4>1st October 2013</h4>
<p>
IITC 0.14.2 and IITC Mobile 0.7.1 have been released. This is a critical update required to work with changes made
to the standard intel site. Additionally, a major update to the mobile app interface has been made, and a handful
of tweaks and bugfixes to IITC and a few plugins.
</p>
<p>
The standard intel site now includes an 'alerts' chat tab. This will be coming to IITC in the future, but it's
better to get this working version released without it than hold things up just for that.
