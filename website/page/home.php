<h3>Latest news</h3>

<h4>15th August 2014</h4>
<p>
IITC 0.17.5 and IITC Mobile 0.11.5 have just been released. This is a critical update required to work
with the latest changes to the standard intel site.
</p>
<p>
Along with the fixes needed to work with the Niantic changes, the only other change since the previous
release is a minor colour scheme change for mods, to match the standard intel site. Rare is now a
shade of blue (rather than purple), and very rare is now purple (rather than pink).
