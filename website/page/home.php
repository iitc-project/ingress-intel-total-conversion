IITC is a browser add-on that modifies the Ingress intel map. It is faster than the standard site, and
offers many more features. It is available for
<a href="?page=desktop">desktop browsers</a>, such as Chrome and Firefox, and as a
<a href="?page=mobile">mobile application</a>.

<h3>Latest news</h3>

<h4>2nd September 2013</h4>
<p>
IITC 0.14.0, and IITC Mobile 0.5.6, have just been released. This is (yet another) change required to work with
the latest changes to the standard intel website.
</p>
<p>
Also, as part of some long-term improvements, the data loading and portal rendering code has been completely rewritten.
This should ensure much more reliable loading of portal data, and faster rendering when lots of portals are shown.
However, this code is new, and may have bugs. Some known issues are:
<ul>
<li>Resonators are not displayed when zoomed in.</li>
<li>Some smaller links/fields are not displayed. Often this is due to changes in the stock map (it doesn't show these
links/fields either), but I think there are cases where IITC is getting it wrong.</li>
</ul>
However, as the current IITC release was broken I think it's better to release this build now rather than wait longer.
