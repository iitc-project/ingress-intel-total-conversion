<h4>27th June 2015</h4>
<p>
IITC 0.24.0 has been released. This is a critical update needed to fix the map not loading any data.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: Niantic have removed portals from the map data at all but the closest of zoom levels (L1+ - zoom 15+).
The stock intel site creates dummy placeholder portals at the anchors for links, allowing you to click and open the
portal details. However, IITC does not do this yet. It will take some time to modify IITC and the plugins to allow
for such placeholder portals, so making a first release without them.
