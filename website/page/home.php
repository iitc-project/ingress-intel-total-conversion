<h3>Latest news</h3>

<h4>16th October 2013</h4>
<p>
IITC 0.14.3 and IITC MObile 0.7.4 have just been released. This is a critical update required to work with the latest
changes Niantic have made to the standard intel site. Additionally, the draw-tools plugin now snaps points to portals
when creating lines/polygons/markers (was actually in 0.14.2 release), a bugfix relating to IITC not realising who 
'you' are, causing some highlighters to break, and a handful of other tweaks/bugfixes.
