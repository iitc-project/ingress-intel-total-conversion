IITC is a browser add-on that modifies the Ingress intel map. It is faster than the standard site, and
offers many more features. It is available for
<a href="?page=desktop">desktop browsers</a>, such as Chrome and Firefox, and as a
<a href="?page=mobile">mobile application</a>.

<h3>Latest news</h3>

<h4>2nd December 2013</h3>
<p>
IITC 0.16.0 and IITC Mobile 0.10.0 have been released. This update is required to work with the latest changes to
the standard intel site. This update took a fair amount of work due to major changes
in the network protocol used behind the standard intel website, hence the longer than usual delay for the update.
</p>
<p>
As well as IITC itself, nearly every single plugin broke in some way due to these changes. Due to the amount of work
needed to get everything possible working again, some plugins have been disabled for now. You can see the list of these
disabled plugins in the download list - they're in the 'Deleted' category with a description of 'PLUGIN CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE'.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after the Niantic changes that broke IITC, there were reports of IITC users being banned. This seemed strange at
first, as IITC was not even functioning at this time, so why would people be using it and getting banned. The conclusion
that was reached was that a few people who tried to use the broken IITC Mobile app triggered either a bug in IITC that
caused excessive requests, or triggered some kind of alert in the intel servers. Changes have been made to IITC now
so this unlikely to be an issue again.

<h4>27th November 2013</h4>
<p>
IITC and IITC Mobile are currently broken, due to changes made to the standard intel website. This is a major change in how
portal details are sent, with most of the extra data that the standard site didn't use being removed.
</p>
<p>
This is not something simple to fix, and will take some time. Also, it severely cripples what IITC can do, as using this
extra data, not displayed by the standard site, was its big feature.
</p>
<p>
We will look into what can be done to get it working again, but it will take some time. Many plugins won't be practical 
as the data will not be available.

</p>
<p>
<b>Update</b> I've created a 'dummy' version of the desktop plugin that will, for now, disable IITC if you leave it installed.
This is shown as version 0.15.99. When a fixed build is released, it will be 0.16.something and will update and start working.
Test versions remain, but broken. Please join the Google+ Community where announcements will be made.
