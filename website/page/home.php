<h4>29th October 2013</h4>
<p>
IITC 0.14.4 and IITC Mobile 0.7.7 have just been released. A critical update required to work with changes made to the
standard intel site. Changes include
<ul>
<li>Fix to geodesic circle drawing. They were not correctly distorted, leading to incorrect link ranges drawn on the map.</li>
<li>Bookmarks plugin: add layer and highlighter to indicate bookmarked portals</li>
<li>Player tracker plugin: markers fade for older activity, and separate layers for each faction</li>
<li>The 'About IITC' dialog now lists which plugins are installed. This may not work correctly for 3rd party plugins at this time</li>
<li>Mobile:
 <ul>
 <li>Custom fullscreen preferences</li>
 <li>Install to SD Card</li>
 <li>Cache move to SD card option (hence the new permissions)</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>... and, as always, various bugfixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>3RD PARTY PLUGIN AUTHORS</b>: The plugin wrapper code has been modified to pass through the additioal version
information. While existing plugins should continue to work, I highly recommend updating the wrapper code in your
scripts to match.

<h4>16th October 2013</h4>
<p>
IITC 0.14.3 and IITC MObile 0.7.4 have just been released. This is a critical update required to work with the latest
changes Niantic have made to the standard intel site. Additionally, the draw-tools plugin now snaps points to portals
when creating lines/polygons/markers (was actually in 0.14.2 release), a bugfix relating to IITC not realising who 
'you' are, causing some highlighters to break, and a handful of other tweaks/bugfixes.
