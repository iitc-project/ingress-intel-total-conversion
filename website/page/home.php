<h3>Latest news</h3>

<h4>12th September 2015</h4>
<p>
IITC 0.25.0 has been released. This is a critical update to fix things after a Niantic site update.
</p>
<p>
Other changes include
</p>
<ul>
<li>"Placeholder portals". Like stock intel, IITC creates clickable portals at the end of links. Portal highlighters
won't work on these as they don't contain enough information</li>
<li>Artifacts loading fixed after a change in data format by Niantic</li>
<li>'show-more-portals' plugin is no longer required - Niantic now return all portals at zoom 15, rather than zoom 17</li>
<li>New plugin: "cache-details-on-map". Caches the portal details as you select portals, and keeps these portals on the map
even when you zoom out</li>
<li>and other tweaks/bugfixes</li>
</ul>
<b>Update 17th September 2015</b>
<p>IITC 0.25.1 released. This fixes search not working after MapQuest made a change to their API.</p>
