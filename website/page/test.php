<h2>Test Builds</h2>

<p>
These test builds are made available for those who would like to try the latest development code without
needing to build it yourself. Automated scripts should update these builds within an hour of a change being
<a href="https://github.com/jonatkins/ingress-intel-total-conversion/commits/master">committed</a> to Github.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-error">
Test builds are built automatically. They could be <b>broken at any time</b>. If you have any doubts about using
unstable software, please use the standard <a href="?page=desktop">desktop</a> or <a href="?page=mobile">mobile</a>
builds.
