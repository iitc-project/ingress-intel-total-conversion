ingress intel total conversion (IITC)
=====================================

Since the [breunigs](https://github.com/breunigs/ingress-intel-total-conversion) IITC branch was deleted,
I've created this one to continue some development.

## Users

Just want to download/install IITC? Go to http://iitc.jonatkins.com/

## Developers

This Github page is for those interested in developing IITC further.

### Roadmap

Assuming I don't get a takedown notice any time soon, the initial plans are:

1. **DONE** Make it easy to rebuild IITC for a new server - will make it easier for development, plus allow others to fork the project for their own use
2. **DONE** Clean up version number handling. Add fork/build info to both IITC and the plugins
3. **DONE** Add separate meta.js files for update checking - reduces load on the web server
4. Get IITC Mobile working, and easily rebuilt for custom development builds/forks

Plus, of course, pulling in any patches/bugfixes.
