ingress intel total conversion (IITC)
=====================================

Since the [breunigs](https://github.com/breunigs/ingress-intel-total-conversion) IITC branch was deleted,
I've created this one to continue some development.

For details on how to download and install, go to http://iitc.jonatkins.com/

This Github page is for those interested in developing IITC further.

Roadmap
-------

Assuming I don't get a takedown notice any time soon:

1. Make it easy to rebuild IITC for a new server - will make it easier for development, plus allow others to fork the project for their own use
2. Clean up version number handling. Add fork/build info to both IITC and the plugins
3. Add separate meta.js files for update checking - reduces load on the web server
4. Get IITC Mobile working, and easily rebuilt for custom development builds/forks
