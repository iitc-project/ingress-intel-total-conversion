Changes
=======

Since the last version from breunigs, the following changes have been made

* Fix up URLs to point to new hosting (icons, etc).
* Removed forced redirect from http to https - it should work on either now.
* Player tracker: change line colour to yellow, increase time to 3 hours
* render limit plugin: increase to 5 times the in-built defaults
