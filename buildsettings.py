# possible fields:
# resourceBaseUrl - optional - the URL base for external resources (all resources embedded in standard IITC)
# distUrlBase - optional - the base URL to use for update checks
# buildMobile - optional - if set, mobile builds are built with 'gradle'. requires the Android SDK and appropriate mobile/local.properties file configured
# preBuild - optional - an array of strings to run as commands, via os.system, before building the scripts
# postBuild - optional - an array of string to run as commands, via os.system, after all builds are complete
